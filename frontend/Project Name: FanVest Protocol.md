Project Name: FanVest Protocol

Core Idea: A decentralized crowdfunding platform that allows fans to collectively invest in their favorite musicians and share in their future success.

How it Works:

Fans Pool Funds: Fans contribute stablecoins (like USDC) into a dedicated funding pool for an artist they want to support. In return, they receive "Fan LP" tokens, which represent their share of the pool.

Earn Interest: The collected funds are automatically deposited into a trusted DeFi lending protocol (like Aave) to generate interest, causing the total value of the pool to grow over time.

Artist Funding: The artist can claim the entire collected fund (principal + interest) to finance their projects, such as a new album or tour.

Shared Success: In exchange for the capital, the fan pool receives a tokenized share of the artist's future streaming royalties. This means fans who contributed are rewarded with a portion of the earnings if the artist's music performs well.

Key Value: FanVest transforms passive fans into active stakeholders, creating a new, transparent, and mutually beneficial economic model for the music industry.
