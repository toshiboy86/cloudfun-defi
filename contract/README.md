# FanVest Protocol Smart Contracts

This directory contains the smart contracts for the FanVest Protocol, a decentralized crowdfunding platform that allows fans to invest in their favorite musicians and share in their future success.

## üéµ Contract Overview

The FanVest Protocol consists of several smart contracts that work together to create a decentralized investment platform for music artists:

### Core Contracts

- **FanVestFactory**: Central registry that deploys and manages individual artist pools
- **FanVestPool**: Individual artist investment pools with ERC-20 LP tokens
- **VerificationRegistry**: Artist verification and authentication system

### Mock Contracts (Testing)

- **MockUSDC**: Test USDC token for development and testing
- **MockAavePool**: Mock Aave V3 Pool for testing DeFi integration
- **MockAUSDC**: Mock Aave USDC token for testing

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

### FanVestFactory
The factory contract serves as the central registry and deployment mechanism:
- Deploys new `FanVestPool` contracts for individual artists
- Tracks all created pools by Spotify Artist ID
- Manages unique holder tracking across all pools
- Provides query functions for pool discovery

### FanVestPool
Each artist gets their own pool contract that:
- Acts as an ERC-20 token for "Fan LP" shares
- Manages USDC deposits and withdrawals
- Automatically invests pooled funds in Aave V3 for yield generation
- Allows artists to claim pooled funds plus earned interest
- Tracks total assets including liquid USDC and aUSDC from Aave

### Key Features

- **1:1 USDC to LP Token Ratio**: Simple and transparent pricing
- **Automatic DeFi Integration**: Funds are automatically deposited into Aave V3
- **Yield Generation**: Pooled funds earn interest through Aave lending
- **Fair Withdrawal**: Users receive their proportional share of total pool assets
- **Artist Claims**: Artists can claim the entire pool value (principal + interest)
- **Emergency Functions**: Safety mechanisms for unexpected situations

## üöÄ Development Setup

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 18+
- pnpm package manager
- Git

### Installation

```bash
# Install dependencies
pnpm install

# Compile contracts
pnpm hardhat compile
```

### Environment Setup

Create a `.env` file in the contract directory with the following variables:

```bash
# Network Configuration
SEPOLIA_RPC_URL=your_sepolia_rpc_url
SEPOLIA_PRIVATE_KEY=your_private_key

# Contract Addresses (for testing)
USDC_ADDRESS=0x... # USDC token address on Sepolia
AAVE_POOL_ADDRESS=0x... # Aave V3 Pool address
AUSDC_ADDRESS=0x... # Aave USDC token address
```

## üß™ Testing

### Running Tests

Run all tests (Solidity + TypeScript):
```bash
npx hardhat test
```

Run only Solidity tests:
```bash
npx hardhat test solidity
```

Run only TypeScript integration tests:
```bash
npx hardhat test nodejs
```

### Test Coverage

The test suite includes:
- Unit tests for individual contract functions
- Integration tests for contract interactions
- Mock contract testing for DeFi integration
- Edge case and error condition testing

## üöÄ Deployment

### Local Development

Deploy to local Hardhat network:
```bash
npx hardhat ignition deploy ignition/modules/deploymentLocal.ts
```

### Sepolia Testnet

Deploy to Sepolia testnet:
```bash
npx hardhat ignition deploy --network sepolia ignition/modules/deploymentSepoliaV7.ts
```

### Setting Up Private Keys

Use Hardhat Keystore for secure key management:
```bash
npx hardhat keystore set SEPOLIA_PRIVATE_KEY
```
